# cpu-scraper
First web scraping attempt
This is supposed to be a first attempt at web scraping the current main branch will scrape the first page of the website newegg.com cpu listing.
It gathers the brand, product name, and shipping price. I am going to try and also add multiple page scraping and also the price.
